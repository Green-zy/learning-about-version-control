## Meeting Hours and Expected Work Hours

- For **mentioned (@) messages**, team members should reply **as soon as possible**, ideally within **2 hours** during work hours.

## Reviews
- Every team member is responsible for submitting a **pull request (PR)** when contributing to the GitHub repository.
- The PR should include a **clear and detailed description**.
- At least **one teammate** should be assigned as a reviewer.
- To ensure all contributions are reviewed, members must also **send a notification on Slack**, prompting others to engage in discussions and provide feedback.

## Roles
- Task assignments and roles will be **evenly distributed** during mandatory in-person meetings whenever new tasks arise.
- If workload imbalances become apparent, team members with lighter assignments or those who finish early **are encouraged to assist others** to ensure deadlines are met efficiently.

## Deadlines

- Each team member is expected to complete their assigned tasks **by huddle time on Saturday**, allowing the team to review the work and submit it on time.

1. **First Warning**: A written notice will be sent via Slack, highlighting the violation and reiterating the expectations outlined in the contract.
2. **Second Warning**: A meeting will be scheduled to discuss the issue, and the team member will be required to provide a **written commitment** to adhering to the contract.
3. **Final Step**: If the behavior continues, the matter will be **escalated to the lab instructor or TAs** for further action.
